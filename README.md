# Producer-Consumer
Producer Consumer implementation

This project involved implementing a 'Producer-Consumer' scenario using POSIX threads and semaphores, where separate threads act as producers and consumers,
adding to and taking from the Queue exclusively.

My work is mostly in helper.h and main.cc
